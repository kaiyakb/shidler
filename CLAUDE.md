# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

Unified portfolio and course materials hub for Shidler College of Business (University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa) courses taught by Adam W. Stauffer. Contains syllabi, assignment frameworks, project templates, branded materials, and professional portfolio documents — all managed via Git/Markdown.

## Repository Structure

- **`courses/`** — All course directories, each following `[CODE]-[Descriptive-Title]` naming (e.g., `courses/BUS-314-International-Corporate-Finance/`)
- **`docs/`** — Centralized documentation hub:
  - `_branding/` — UH Mānoa design tokens (`design.json`) and visual reference (`design-system.html`)
  - `templates/` — Reusable assignment templates (memo, spec, case brief, risk memo, prompt log)
  - `decisions/` — Strategic decision memos; course-specific decisions live in `decisions/<course-code>/` subdirs (e.g., `decisions/bus314/`, `decisions/fin321/`)
  - `ai-usage-guidelines.md`, `writing-style-guide.md`, `reproducibility-playbook.md`
- **`BIO.md`** — Single source of truth for instructor biography; course READMEs link here
- **`_archive/`** — Deprecated/historical materials; course-specific archives live in `_archive/<course-code>/` subdirs (e.g., `_archive/fin321/`)
- **`scripts/`** — Repo-level tooling scripts; spreadsheet cleanup pipelines live in `scripts/spreadsheets/`

### Within each course directory

- `README.md` — Standardized syllabus (overview, objectives, grading, AI policy, campus policies)
- `project-[name]/` or `[project-name]/` — Active project with stage assignments
- `_templates/excel/` — Skeleton Excel workbooks
- `_spreadsheets/` — Master financial models
- `_tools/` — Course-specific scripts (e.g., grading scanners)
- Project-level `archive/` subdirectories may exist for per-project historical iterations; full-course archives are consolidated under root `_archive/<course-code>/`

## Project Workflow

Most projects follow a reusable pedagogical pattern. The default is five stages:

1. **Memo** (Stage 1) — Executive summary and problem framing
2. **Specification** (Stage 2) — Technical planning, methodology, pseudocode
3. **Excel Build** (Stage 3) — Quantitative/financial model in Excel
4. **Prompt Engineering** (Stage 4) — AI integration and prompt documentation
5. **Final Recommendations** (Stage 5) — Synthesis and actionable insights

**BUS-314 uses a 4-stage variant** (build-first, prompt merged into final):
1. Memo → 2. Excel Build → 3. Spec (post-build) → 4. Final Analysis + Prompt

Stage files are named `stage[N]-[description]-assignment.md`. Templates for deliverables are `template-memo.md` and `template-spec.md`.

## Active Courses

| Code | Title | Level | Key Project |
|------|-------|-------|-------------|
| BUS 313 | Economic & Financial Environment of Global Business | Undergrad | Trade/geopolitics case studies |
| BUS 314 | International Business Finance | Undergrad | Accounting ratios (4-stage, 25+ ratios) |
| FIN 321 | International Finance & Securities | Upper undergrad | FX hedging (5-stage) |
| BUS 620 | Micro & Macro Economics | MBA | Team cases + individual research |
| BUS 122B | Intro Entrepreneurship/Sustainable Ag | Community college | Business plan + pitch |
| BUS 629 | International Corporate Finance | Vietnam EMBA | In development |

## UH Mānoa Brand System

Full design tokens live in `docs/_branding/design.json`. Key values:

- **Primary:** UH Green `#024731` — logos, headings, accents
- **Secondary:** Black `#000000` — body text, borders
- **Typography:** Open Sans (Bold headings, Regular body); Avenir for print
- **Accessibility:** ADA-compliant contrast ratios required; minimum 10pt body text

The `brand-guidelines` skill applies these standards automatically. Use it when creating any UH-branded materials.

## Writing and AI Conventions

- **Writing style:** Lead with 100–150 word executive summary; active voice; trim jargon; cite figures/tables in-text
- **AI use is optional, not required** for student projects
- **AI logging:** Meaningful prompts/outputs go in `deliverables/prompt-log.md`; AI-assisted sections marked in memos
- **Reproducibility:** Record dataset links + access dates; keep raw vs. clean data separate; tag releases for milestones

## Naming Conventions

- Course directories: `courses/[CODE]-[Descriptive-Title]` with PascalCase hyphens
- `_`-prefixed directories (`_templates/`, `_archive/`, `_branding/`) denote system/organizational content
- Excel named ranges for BUS-314: `BAL_`, `INC_`, `CASH_`, `RATIO_` prefixes (see `bus314-accounting-ratios` skill for full spec)
